# base

A lightweight PHP/JS router and MVC framework, build for hand written web applications.

## Main goals

* clean code: write web applications with ease and keep your code structured
* easy to learn: uses well known patterns and design paradigms
* painless setup and use: own namespace, no globals
* use the same model on both, client and server side: send and receive PHP/JS objects in a smooth transition
* no include/require chaos

## Requirements

* PHP (latest version recommended)
* JS
* .htaccess support (RewriteEngine and FollowSymLinks)
* jQuery (include before *base* JS files!)
* MySQL (optional)
